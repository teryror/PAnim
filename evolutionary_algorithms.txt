Natural Selection and Evolutionary Algorithms:
- give a brief overview of biological evolution
  -> there exists a population of organisms
  -> organisms reproduce (CAVEAT: reproduction is imperfect; generally,
     you won't get an exact copy, some characteristics will vary randomly)
  -> organisms eventually die (CAVEAT: some die faster than others,
     depending on how well-adapted they are to their environment)
- evolution is the emergent behaviour of this system
  -> as time goes on, the population of organisms is optimized for adaption
     to the environment
- this effect has been observed and was already well understood relatively
  long ago, and has been shown to generalize => evolutionary algorithms
  -> show samples of a function f(x,y), and animate a genetic algorithm
     that finds a maximum (show the function as a color-coded image,
     optimize a population of 2D points in the appropriate color)
  -> point out that this can also be used to find good neural network topologies,
     and that generative adversarial networks build on a similar idea
- note that others have also tried to use this effect:
  -> free market economy optimizes a population of companiees for maximum profitability
  -> social darwinism (or, more generally, meritocracy) tries to apply it to human
     society
- guiding question: how can biological evolution lead to general intelligence?
  -> sheer complexity of the domain of organisms; the capability to achieve general
     intelligence is inherent to the system being optimized
- point out the prevalence of reward hacking:
  -> humans interfering with the evolution of other species directly (from dogbreeds
     to GMOs) and indirectly (building cities, polluting the environment) has drastically
     affected biodiversity
  -> companies optimizing for profit eventually form monopolies, and get into a position
     where they can crush competition before it becomes a danger to themselves, and become
     powerful enough to affect politics, allowing them to modify laws to suit themselves
  => note the feedback loop: this comes down to the population being part of the environment
     that determines who gets to 'reproduce', and who has to 'die off'
- final point: stress the relevance of AI safety research in political science, and vice-versa
